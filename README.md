# Kubernetes for Spring Boot Developers

## Introduction
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is widely used in cloud-native environments to orchestrate microservices-based applications. As a Spring Boot developer, knowing how to integrate and deploy your Spring Boot applications in Kubernetes environments is essential for building scalable, resilient applications.

This guide covers the essential Kubernetes concepts and practices that a Spring Boot developer should be familiar with.

## Key Concepts for Spring Boot Developers

### 1. **Containers & Docker**
   - **Containerization**: Before deploying your Spring Boot application to Kubernetes, you must containerize it using Docker. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container.
   - **Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image of your Spring Boot application.
   
   Example of a simple `Dockerfile` for a Spring Boot app:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:11-jdk-slim
   COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar /app.jar
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
